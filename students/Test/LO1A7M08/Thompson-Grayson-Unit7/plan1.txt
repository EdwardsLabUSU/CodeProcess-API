System design
    1) import time - import deck from Deck
    2) Prompt user for input of how many players from 1-5 for the game blackjack
    3) set up starting bank/ betting money for users strting at $100
    4) start by drawing from deck  from starter code
    5) draw two random cards per user one user at a time
    6) draw two cards for dealer and only reveal second card
    7) start by showing first persons hand and asking for a hit to draw more cards or to hold to stay with hand
            once player holds then continue on to next user and so on
    8) if player bust then they lose
            player busts if hand is greater than 21
    9) if player holds then skips to next player
            player can still win if hand is less than 21 but greater than dealers hands
            player will lose if they hold but have a hand less than the dealers hand
    10) after all players have gone dealer displays cards and then draws more if their total isnt more than 17
    11) if the dealers hand starts at above 17 then dealer holds automatically
    12) determine winners by figuring out who had the higher hand compared to the dealer
            determine losers by determining whos hand was smaller than dealers
            if users hands are same then dealers than state a tie
    13) payouts
            winners add the amount bet to initial users balance bet
            losers subtract the amount bet to the initial users balance bet
    14) display users
            total money after payouts were added or subtracted to initial amount
    15) prompt user if user wants to play again
    16) if user doesnt want to play again thank them for playing
