SYS DESIGN
    create empty list
    prompt user for number of players
    append number of players +1 empty list (for dealer)
    for each list appended the first value in the list will be the players balance
    set the balance = 100$
    #playerBets
        define the function as private
        if the players balance <= 5 and >= 0
            they bet the remaining balance
        elif the players balance = 0
            skip player
        else (player balance > 5)
            player input the amount they want to bet
            check against remaining balance
            if less than = to remaining balance
            subtract amount from balance
            add amount to bet


        call the function to deal the cards

        if a players delt value > dealer delt value and player delt value <= 21
            player bet doubles
    #dealTheCards
        shuffle the cards
        for each player use the deck.draw() function
        append the drawn value to list possition(1) for each player
        do the same for the dealer
        have each player draw a second card and append them to the list[2] position
        do the same for the dealer.
        call the list[2] position for the dealer

    #sumOfCardValues
        use card.getCardValue() to get numeric assignment of cards
        jack, queen, king = 10
        other values = themselves
        sum the value of cards
        if sum < = 21
            ace = 11
        elif sum > 21
            ace = 1


    #playerHands
        call the possition[1,2] in each player list to print.

                        prompt user input (hit or bust)
                            if user input == hit or Hit or HIT
                                deck.draw() to draw card and append card to user list[x]
                                total values for user list[1,x]

                            else:
                                return total values for user input

                     print bust
                     lose bet

    #dealersTurn
        call values from dealer list[2,3]
        use time.sleep() function to delay dealer for 1 sec
        call dealer hit or hold function
            dealer hit or hold function
                define function name
