create empty list hands, zero is always dealer
create empty list values
create empty list for bets
create empty 2d list for loosers winners and ties

THIS PLAN IS ALL SORTS OF BACKWARDS AND DOESNT WORK
THE ACTUAL PROGRAM FOLLOWS THE SAME CONCEPT, DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION

Ask user for number of players

for number of players
    append a list to the list of hands
    append 100 to list values

deck = deck()

while playAgain:
    for i in range(len(hands))
        if
    ask for bet
    for i in range(hands)
        ask player how much they would like to bet
        append that to bet list

    deal the cards
        for i in range(2)
            for j in range(players)
                add a card to hand[[j][i]

    for i in range(players[1:]))
        hold = false
        print what player is playing
        while not hold:
            getsum(hand[i], aceValue) # include an ace check in this
            show player hand
            show player sum
            check for bust
            if bust:
                print they busted
                append [i] to loosers list
                break loop
            ask if they would like to hit or hold
            if hold:
                hold = true
            elif hit:
                give them new card
                set ace value to true if new card is ace. (removes the need for a search function)

    print dealer card one
    print dealer card two
    dealer value = getsum(hands[0])
    while dealerValue <= 17
        time.sleep(1)
        give the dealer a new card
        print the dealer takes a card
        print new card
        set ace to true if card is ace
        dealerValue = getsum(hand[0], aceValue)
        if dealerValue > 21
            print the dealer busts
            give all players there bets
            break

    for i in range(players[1:])
        value = getsum(i)
        if dealerValue == value
            add i to tie list
        elif dealerValue > value
            add i to looser list
        elif dealervalue < value
            add i to winners lsit
