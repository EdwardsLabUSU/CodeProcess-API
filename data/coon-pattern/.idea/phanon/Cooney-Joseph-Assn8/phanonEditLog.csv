Requirements specification
    3 modes
    pattern.py - You must define the following functions inside of this module
        reset()
            Erase all of the patterns and start over
        setup()
            Configure turtle to draw quickly
            Configure turtle to have a window of 1000 x 800
        drawRectanglePattern()
            Use appropriate parameters - must include
                Center position - This is the x, y center point of the circular pattern that is drawn
                Offset - This is the distance from the center position to the starting corner of each rectangle. It can be a positive or negative number
                Height - The height of a rectangle
                Width - The width of a rectangle
                Count - The number of rectangles to draw within the 360 degree pattern.
                Rotation - The number of degrees each rectangle is rotated in relation to the line from the Center Position to the starting corner of the rectangle
                each rectangle must be a new random color (at least 4 different colors)
            It should call drawRectangle()
        drawRectangle()
            Use appropriate parameters
            Should draw a SINGLE rectangle
        drawCirclePattern()
            Use appropriate parameters - these should include
                Center position - This is the x, y center point of the circular pattern that is drawn
                Offset - This is the distance from the center position to starting drawing point of each circle.  It can be a positive or negative number. Note that the center point of each circle should be 'radius + offset' distance from the Center Position of the pattern.
                Radius - The radius of the circle
                Count - The number of circles to draw within the 360 degree pattern.
                each circle must be a new random color (at least 4 different colors)
        drawSuperPattern()
            Use appropriate parameters
            Randomly draw Rectangle and Circle patterns. Each pattern should based on random values.
            Use reasonable random values (some can be negative) so patterns are drawn on the screen
        setRandomColor()
            Do not use any parameters
            Set turtle to draw in a random color
            Use at least 4 colors
        done()
        Called when user quits
        Keeps the turtle window open
    use starter code

System Analysis
    use a pattern module with the 6 formulas described above for the rectangles and the 4 described above for the circles
    no mathematical formulas

System Design - task1.py
    add import statements - turtle and pattern
    add input statements for
        rectangle,
            Center position
            Offset
            Height
            Width
            Count
            Rotation
        circle,
            center position
            offset
            radius
            count
        and super patterns
            number of patterns to draw
    add statements to clear drawings/ play again
        if response == 3:
            playAgain = false
        elif response == 2:
            clear window
            call setup()

System design - pattern.py
    define reset()
