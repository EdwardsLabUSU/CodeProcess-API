System Des   

    import random
    user will input information 
the pattern module will have several function
        setup() -
ign will make turtle draw quickly
                    make turtle have a window of 1000 * 800
        reset() - turtle will erase everything
        drawRectenglePattern() - will call draw rectangle
                                center position is x, y of circular pattern drawn
                                Offset- distance from center to starting corner

        drawRectangle() - draw a single rectangle
        drawCirclePatten() -
        drawSuperPattern() - randomly draw rectangle and circle patterns based on random values
        drawRandomColor()- do not use any perameters and make turtle draw in 1/4 random colors
        done()-called when user quits, keeps window open

    drawRectanglePattern()
        numbers 1 - 4 will be assigned to colors

        user will input center possition
        will go to center position
        user will input the number of rectangles
        number degree between starting corners wi        for statement with number of rectangles being the range
ll be determined by 360 / number of rectangles
        user will input offset length
        pickup pen
        go to cos*x, sin*y
        putdown pen
        user will input rotation of starting corner
        user will input the width of the rectangle
         user will input the length
        user wil        pen will go forward length of rectangle and turn right 90
        user will input the length
        pen will travel length
        pen will turn right 90
 itself to go said distance
        f rectangles
